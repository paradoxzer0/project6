    <h2>A place I would like to visit</h2>

    <p>I would really love to visit Tokyo, Japan. It's a place that always seems to be full of life and technology. From what I have seen, Tokyo
  has no shortage on fun activities. From festivals to arcades to restaurants, Tokyo seems like a great place to vacation at.</p>

    <h2>A person I admire <br> (past or present)</h2> 
  
    <p>Gabe Newell is someone who I have admired. He created an entire gaming company because he believed it was
  what he was meant to do. With this thought alone, he set out and achieved his goal.</p>
